# Project-3

In this project, I followed the instructions in this lab: [Distributed Image Processing in Cloud Dataproc]( https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/5834?catalog_rank=%7B%22rank%22%3A7%2C%22num_filters%22%3A0%2C%22has_search%22%3Atrue%7D&parent=catalog&search_id=4914974), and learnt how to use Apache Spark on Cloud Dataproc to distribute a computationally intensive image processing task onto a cluster of machines.
